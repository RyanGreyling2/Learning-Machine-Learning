# Learning-Machine-Learning
This is a repository for the Wells Fargo 2020 Analytics Competition.
Developed by Ryan Greyling, Jules Mockovak, and David Atherton in VS code liveshare.

We were provided a dataset and tasked with building a model that could predict outputs based on the input data.
In this repository, we built a neural network model with feature selection which was able to successfully predict outputs with 98% accuracy on data inputs it hadn't been tested on.
Using this model, we were able to achieve top 10 in the competition.
